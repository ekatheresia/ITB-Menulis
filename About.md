This project is part of my last assignment for integrative programming and being developing from November 2016. This project is one of many web services that will be
integrated into a website. ITB Menulis itself is a web service that allow every student in Institut Teknologi Bandung to integrate their blog to our-soon-to-be-launced-website
so that they will not be asked to make another account or re-write their content into our-soon-to-be-launced-website. In nutshell, hopefully, this webservice provides autoblogging. 
I, Eka Theresia Kartika Suri, hope with this project, every writing that every student has in my campus can be read in a website by everyone else. But well, it's hard tho that I can't
even understand. So...wish me luck !
